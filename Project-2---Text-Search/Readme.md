Text Searcher using Hashtable for indexing and Binary Search Trees for collision management.

  The text we want to search is located in 1 or more .txt files. 
  The program takes as input the "input.txt" file which contains the names of the .txt files which contain the text.
  Then the user specifies a word as input from the keyboard and presses enter. 
  The output specifies file,line and column in which the input word was found in format "file(line,col)"
  
This folder contains a test input (file "input.txt"). It contains the names alpha.txt,beta.txt and gamma.txt
which are the three source files for the text we want to search. These are also included in this folder.
