Project 1 : Database of Authors and Books implemented with linked lists

Project 2 : Text Searcher using Hashtable for indexing and Binary Search Trees for collision management
  The text we want to search is located in 1 or more .txt files. The program takes as input the "input.txt" file which contains the names of the .txt files which contain the text. Then the user specifies a word as input from the keyboard and presses enter. The output specifies file,line and column in which the input word was found in format "file(line,col)"
