Project 1 : Database of Authors and Books implemented with linked lists
  Takes an input file containing a list of authors, their books and some extra information from an input file. The program stores the information about the authors and their books. The authors are stored in a sorted linked list according to their ID number. The books are also stored in a linked list. Each node of the authorlist(eg each author entry) has a pointer to the head of their book list. The program finally prints the contents of the database in format (Author,Book,Sales of Book) in the output.txt file. Also it prints a list of popular authors (sales >10.000).
  
Project 2 : Text Searcher using Hashtable for indexing and Binary Search Trees for collision management
  The text we want to search is located in 1 or more .txt files. The program takes as input the "input.txt" file which contains the names of the .txt files which contain the text. Then the user specifies a word as input from the keyboard and presses enter. The output specifies file,line and column in which the input word was found in format "file(line,col)"
